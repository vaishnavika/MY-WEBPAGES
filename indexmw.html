            In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective �𦣇licking�� together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

            The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.

            </h5> <p> Not the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, certainly. Disney will continue to pump out films as long as they can, moving beyond Phase 4 and into the stories of Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther and many more heroes across the big and little screens. But this film, the fourth Avengers team-up event, is the end of an era. It’s the denouement for the prime heroes Marvel has painstakingly established and cultivated over the last decade {and which have helped them build their popular empire}. Our Avengers are given fitting endings, both the icons afforded franchises all their own — RDJ’s cavalier Iron Man, and Evans’ idealized Captain America — and the more human, more focused specialists and franchise outsiders of Scarlet Johannson’s Black Widow and Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye. This is their story, alongside the wayward trails of Bruce Banner’s defeated-to-reconciled Hulk and Chris Hemsworth’s hearty, despairing and ultimately worthy Thor. A<p>

    <img src="https://cdn.cdnparenting.com/articles/2018/07/692127646-H.jpg">
    <p>Ihave a beautiful cycle. It is purple in color. I love to ride my cycle very much.<br>We use to go to a field which is a little far away from our home. But with the help of our cycles, we reach there in a few minutes. That field is very big and all of us ride our cycles there. It is a very enjoyable moment for me to ride my cycle as it makes me feel like I am flying in the sky.I still remember the day when my father bought me this cycle as I had scored very good marks in 2th standard. That was one of the happiest days of my life as it was my dream to have a beautiful cycle of my own. I rode the cycle for the whole day when I got it. It was a four-wheel cycle at that time. I would be able to ride it very easily. But after a few days, my father removed the side wheels from my cycle. I was very scared to ride it without side wheels but my father helped me a lot and teaches me how to keep the balance in it. At the initial stage, I fell down a lot of time but at last I managed to ride it alone without the help of my father.
<br>Now I use my cycle for going to the school as well. My father allowed me to go to the school with my cycle when I learned to ride it comfortably. Now I also help my mom by going to the nearby shops with the help of my cycle. I love my cycle so much and I will always ride it in future.</p>

For technical reasons, "Sing#" redirects here. For superset in Spec# (A.K.A. Spec Sharp), see Sing Sharp.<br><br>
Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and popular music). Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock and electronic dance music.<br><br>
Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger. Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.</p>

    <h1>My Hobby : Dancing</h1>

        <h1>Indian classical dance</h1>
           <div class="line"></div>
       <p>Indian classical dance or 'Shastriya Devesh' is an umbrella term for various performance arts rooted in religious Hindu musical theatre styles,whose theory and practice can be traced to the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra<br>
 The number of recognised classical dances range from eight to more, depending on the source and scholar. The Sangeet Natak Academy recognizes eight – Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Sattriya, Manipuri and Mohiniyattam. Scholars such as Drid Williams add Chhau, Yakshagana and Bhagavata Mela to the list. Additionally, the Indian Ministry of Culture includes Chhau in its classical list. These dances are traditionally regional, all of them include music and recitation in local language or Sanskrit, and they represent a unity of core ideas in a diversity of styles, costumes and expression.</p>
       <h2>Types of classical dances</h2>
       <p>The Natya Shastra is the foundational treatise for classical dances of India, and this text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.<br>While the Natya Shastra is the revered ancient text in the Hindu tradition, there are numerous other ancient and medieval Sanskrit dance-drama related texts that further discuss and expand on the classical repertoire of performance arts, such as the Abhinaya Darpana, Abhinava Bharati, Natya Darpana, Bhava Prakasa and many others. The term "classical" (Sanskrit: "Shastriya") denotes the ancient Indian Shastra-based performing arts.<br>The text Natya Shastra describes religious arts as a form as margi, or a "spiritual traditional path" that liberates the soul, while the folk entertainment is called desi, or a "regional popular practice".<br>Indian classical dances are traditionally performed as an expressive drama-dance form of religious performance art, related to Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, pan-Hindu Epics and the Vedic literature, or a folksy entertainment that includes story-telling from Sanskrit or regional language plays. As a religious art, they are either performed inside the sanctum of a Hindu temple, or near it. Folksy entertainment may also be performed in temple grounds or any fairground, typically in a rural setting by travelling troupes of artists; alternatively, they have been performed inside the halls of royal courts or public squares during festivals.</p>
       <h3>Dance forms</h3>
       <p>The Natya Shastra mentions four Pravrittis (traditions, genres) of ancient dance-drama in vogue when it was composed – Avanti (Ujjain, central), Dakshinatya (south), Panchali (north, west) and Odra-Magadhi (east).<br>Sources differ in their list of Indian classical dance forms. Encyclopædia Britannica mentions six dances. The Sangeet Natak Akademi has given recognition to nine Indian dances. The Indian government's Ministry of Culture includes eleven dance forms. Scholars such as Drid Williams and others include Chhau, Yaksagana and Bhagavata Mela to the eight classical Indian dances in the Sangeet Natak Akademi list.</p><h4>The classical dance forms recognised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Ministry of Culture are:</h4>
